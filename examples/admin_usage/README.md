### OpenAI Administration Endpoints

The examples in this directory require the use of an Admin API Key, which differ from a normal API key.  You must create at least one Admin API Key using the OpenAI Console before using these functions.

You can generate the link in the [Admin Keys Console](https://platform.openai.com/organization/admin-keys).

For additional information, refer to the Administrator section of the [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/administration).
